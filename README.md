# shapes2stl

[Source](https://github.com/gecrooks/shapes2stl)

Python script to generate STLs for all of the Platonic, Archimedean, Catalan, and Johnson solids,
along with a selection of prisms and anti-prisms.

Download code, install dependencies, and create STL terrain models.

    > git clone https://github.com/gecrooks/shapes2stl.git
    > cd shapes2stl
    > pip install -r requirements.txt
    > python -m shapes2stl

All solids are scaled to have the same volume as a 1 kg cube of tungsten (38mm (1.5") on a side).

This was a warm up project to get the hang of generating STL files with python.
